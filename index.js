                    <p>i'll be pursuing <b>Computer Science @ Purdue University</b> this fall. 
                        my foundation lies in engineering: i've lead as President and Lead Payload Engineer for my Aerial
                        Robotics team. beyond robotics, i've worked with human-computer interaction, virtual reality systems and machine
                        learning through <b> mobile development, simulation/game development, and embedded systems programming.</b> 
                        i aim to make digital yet human-centric solutions to real technical problems. i'm especially drawn to interdisciplinary challenges, 
                        threading design, software, and hardware.

                        find me watching movies and attempting to be a film connoisseur, drawing characters in my sketchbook, and being
                        with my family. i also have an origami collection of miscellaneous sorts: Star Wars, animals, random
                        cool shapes.
